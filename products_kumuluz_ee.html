										<h3>Migrate your application to the cloud â€“ a microservice framework for Java EE </h3>
									</header>
									<p>
										KumuluzAPI is an innovative Service API Management and Marketplace solution that allows you to centrally manage services and APIs implemented as microservices or hosted on back-end application servers. KumuluzAPI automatically discovers services and is fully integrated with Continuous Integration and Delivery cycles, thus guaranteeing that the API catalog is always in-sync with actual deployments.
									</p>
									<p>Key features:<br />
										KumuluzEE allows you to decompose Java EE applications into microservices and prepare them for the cloud. It allows you to create standalone lightweight Java EE microservices that can be efficiently deployed, executed and scaled in the cloud on PaaS and Docker-like environments or as standalone applications. KumuluzEE microservices have minimal footprint and require minimal or no configuration. KumuluzEE automates the tasks, related to the deployment and configuration of Java EE microservices, thus overcoming the major drawback of the microservice architecture and eliminating the need for an application server.
									</p>
									<p>
										KumuluzEE provides an efficient way to migrate existing Java EE applications to microservices and make them ready for the cloud. The major advantage is that you can migrate Java EE applications iteratively, step-by-step. You can take a few services and pack them as microservices, while the rest still runs on your existing Java EE application servers (such as Oracle WebLogic, WildFly or IBM WebSphere). Full interoperability between microservices and application server is provided.
										Full integration with Service API Management
									</p>
									<p>
										KumuluzEE is fully integrated with KumuluzAPI, a novel Service API Management product that allows you to centrally manage services and APIs implemented as microservices or hosted on a Java EE application server. KumuluzAPI automatically discovers services and is fully integrated with Continuous Integration and Delivery cycles, thus guaranteeing that the API catalog is always in-sync with actual deployments.

									<h2>About company</h2>
									
									<p>
									
										Sunesis name was not chosen randomly, but communicates the core values represented by the company.
										The Greeks had three great words describing three great qualities of the mind. If a man possessed these three qualities he had a mind equipped.
										The first of these words is Sophia - wisdom of ultimate things.
										The second of the three great words is Phronesis - prudence.
										The third of the great Greek words of the mind is Sunesis. Sunesis literally means uniting, bringing together, integrating. It would be true to say that Sunesis is that faculty of putting two and two together.
										In its essence Sunesis is the power to asses, distinguish, criticize and evaluate, understand and to form judgments.
