<p ><span lang=EN-US
style='font-family:"Book Antiqua",serif;mso-ansi-language:EN-US'>It is
important to note that the processing of personal data in the
&quot;GREEN.DAT.AI&quot; EV Crowdsensing app is limited to what is necessary
for the specified purposes, in accordance with the data minimization principle
outlined in Article 5(1)(c) of the GDPR. We only collect and process personal
data that is relevant, adequate, and limited to what is necessary for the
purposes described above. We regularly review our data collection practices ensuring
that we do not collect or retain more personal data than is needed to fulfill
these purposes.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p ><span lang=EN-US
style='font-family:"Book Antiqua",serif;mso-ansi-language:EN-US'>Furthermore,
we have implemented appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure
that, by default, only personal data which is necessary for each specific
purpose of the processing is processed, as required by Article 25(2) of the
GDPR (data protection by default). This means that the app's default settings
are designed to minimize the collection and processing of personal data, and
users must actively choose to provide additional data or enable certain

style='font-family:"Book Antiqua",serif;mso-ansi-language:EN-US'>12. To ensure
the security and privacy of your personal data, we have implemented various
technical measures in our backend systems. When you create an account, your
email address and password are securely transmitted to our servers using
industry-standard encryption protocols, such as SSL/TLS. Your password is then
hashed using a strong, one-way cryptographic function, such as <span
class=SpellE>bcrypt</span>, with a unique salt for each password. This means
that your actual password is never stored in our database, and even if our
systems were compromised, attackers would not be able to retrieve your original
password.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p ><span lang=EN-US
style='font-family:"Book Antiqua",serif;mso-ansi-language:EN-US'>13. All
personal data, including your name, vehicle details, and ride history, are
encrypted at rest using AES-256 encryption, which is a highly secure encryption
standard. Access to this data is strictly limited to authorized personnel who
need it to perform their job functions, such as providing customer support or
improving our services. We maintain detailed access logs and regularly monitor
them for any suspicious activity.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p ><span lang=EN-US
style='font-family:"Book Antiqua",serif;mso-ansi-language:EN-US'>14. When you
use the app's features, such as live ride tracking, your location data is
transmitted to our servers using secure, encrypted connections. We use advanced
anonymization techniques, such as tokenization, to replace sensitive data with
a non-sensitive equivalent, called a token, that has no extrinsic or
exploitable meaning or value. This helps to protect your privacy and reduce the
risk of your personal data being compromised.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p ><span lang=EN-US
style='font-family:"Book Antiqua",serif;mso-ansi-language:EN-US'>15. We also
employ pseudonymization techniques to replace personally identifiable
information with a pseudonym, such as a unique identifier, in our backend
systems. This means that your personal data is processed in such a manner that
it can no longer be attributed to you without the use of additional
information, which is kept separately and subject to technical and
organizational measures to ensure that your personal data is not attributed to
an identified or identifiable natural person.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p ><span lang=EN-US
style='font-family:"Book Antiqua",serif;mso-ansi-language:EN-US'>16. Our

<p >- Security information and event management
(SIEM) tools to monitor our systems for suspicious activity and alert us to
potential security incidents.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p >- Endpoint protection, such as antivirus
and anti-malware software, to protect our devices from malicious software.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p >- Secure coding practices, such as input

SQL injection and cross-site scripting (<span class=SpellE>XSS</span>) attacks.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p ><span lang=EN-US
style='font-family:"Book Antiqua",serif;mso-ansi-language:EN-US'>23. We also
maintain a comprehensive incident response plan that outlines the steps we will
take in the event of a data breach or other security incident. This plan
includes procedures for detecting, reporting, and investigating incidents, as
well as communicating with affected individuals and relevant authorities, in
accordance with Articles 33 and 34 of the GDPR.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p ><span lang=EN-US
style='font-family:"Book Antiqua",serif;mso-ansi-language:EN-US'>24. Our

<p ><span lang=EN-US
style='font-family:"Book Antiqua",serif;mso-ansi-language:EN-US'>25. In
addition to these technical and organizational measures, we also conduct
regular data protection impact assessments (<span class=SpellE>DPIAs</span>) to
identify and mitigate potential risks to your personal data, in accordance with
Article 35 of the GDPR. These assessments help us evaluate the necessity and
proportionality of our data processing activities and implement appropriate
safeguards to protect your rights and freedoms.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p ><span lang=EN-US
style='font-family:"Book Antiqua",serif;mso-ansi-language:EN-US'>26. When
