We're happy to announce the initial version of the **KumuluzEE Discovery**
extension v1.0.0 for the KumuluzEE framework.

<!--more-->

The extension comes with support for using the etcd or Consul as the backend for
registering and finding microservices in your system. We're continuing the
spirit of complete modularity. The API is the same no matter which backend you
choose to use, and as such can freely change between them without impacting your
code. The same will hold true for any additional future backends that we will
add.

We're excited to get the extension into your hands!
