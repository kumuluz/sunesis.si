KumuluzEE Metrics, an implementation of the Eclipse MicroProfile Metrics API, has been updated to support the Eclipse
MicroProfile Metrics 1.1.

New version adds a flag `reusable` to the Metadata object, which primarily means, that a metric can be injected multiple
times in multiple places. Acquisition of global tags was changed from environment variable `MP_METRICS_TAGS` to
MicroProfile Config property with the same name. This means, that global tags can additionally be supplied via the
[MicroProfile Config extension](https://github.com/kumuluz/kumuluzee-config-mp).
